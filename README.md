# About Hearb
Hearb is an AI-powered interface that gives a voice to the silent world of your plants.

While plants have always communicated through drooping leaves or slow growth, we often miss the message until it’s too late.

Hearb translates biological data—like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity into a natural human conversation.

Instead of staring at a complex dashboard or guessing if your plant is happy, you can simply text your plant.

Thanks to a personality-driven AI model, your plants don't just send notifications; they have conversations.

If it’s dry: "I'm feeling a bit parched today, could I get a drink?"

If it’s dark: "I'm missing the sun, can you move me closer to the window?"

With Hearb, you aren't just maintaining a plant; you're listening to life.
